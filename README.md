## Title: "E-Waste Facility Locator"

## Problem Statement:
The improper disposal of electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing environmental concern in India.
Many individuals are unaware of how and where to safely dispose of their old electronic devices.
There is a strong need for a system that helps citizens easily locate certified e-waste collection and recycling centers, educates them about the dangers of improper disposal, and encourages responsible recycling behavior through awareness programs and reward systems.

Objective:
1.To develop an easy-to-use platform (web and mobile) that enables users to:
2.Find the nearest certified e-waste facilities.
3.Schedule doorstep pickups for large electronic items.
4.Learn safe disposal methods through interactive educational tools.
5.Track their contribution toward a cleaner environment.


## Key Issues
ðŸ”¹ Lack of Public Awareness
Many users do not know about the harmful effects of improper e-waste disposal.
Limited knowledge about the existence of certified recycling centers.

ðŸ”¹ Accessibility Challenges
Difficulty in locating nearby authorized e-waste facilities.
Lack of integrated digital platforms that link users to recycling centers.

ðŸ”¹ Improper Data Handling
Devices discarded without proper data wiping pose cybersecurity risks.

ðŸ”¹ Low Recycling Incentives
Lack of motivation among users to recycle due to absence of rewards or acknowledgment.

ðŸ”¹ Unregulated E-Waste Disposal
Many e-waste items end up in landfills or informal sectors, causing environmental pollution.

ðŸ”¹ Tracking and Accountability Issues
No easy way to track the amount of e-waste recycled at an individual level.


## Idea

1.Smart Locator with Filters

*Users can find nearby authorized e-waste centers.
*Filter results by:
   *Facility type (Collection center, Recycling plant, Repair center)
   *Accepted materials (Batteries, Mobiles, Computers, etc.)
 
2.Doorstep Pickup Request

 *Schedule pickups for large items like TVs, refrigerators.
 *Facility assigns pickup slots.

3.Eco-Learning Hub

*Interactive modules and quizzes about:
  *What happens to e-waste?
  *Why recycling matters?
  *How individuals can contribute?

4.Certification and Rewards

*Issue digital certificates for users contributing more than 10kg of e-waste.
*Partner with brands for discount coupons as rewards.

5.Track Your Impact

*Show users statistics like:
*Kilograms recycled.
*Amount of greenhouse gas emissions saved.
*Contribution badges.
